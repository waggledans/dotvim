== positive lookahead ==
q(?=a)  will match qa but will not match qc 
== negative lookahead ==
q(?!a)  will not match qa but will match qc 
= positive lookbehind = 
(?<=a)b will match ab but will not match cb
= negative lookbehind = 
(?<!a)b will not match ab but will match cb
= condition =

(?(?=condition)(then1|then2|then3)|(else1|else2|else3))
== using positive lookahead ==
(?(?=regex)then|else)
== example ==
(a)?b(?(1)c|d) # matches bd and abc. 
It does not match bc, but does match bd in abd
explanation: a is optional. b is mandatory 
note: if you use a ref to a group in a conditional, use (a)? instead of (a?).
