1. Save your signal as a timeseries:
Could be done from Simulink using sink module with timeseries property chosen
# adding a sample to timeseries
ts = timeseries(data,time)  % where data is array of data and time is array of time - should be the same dimension
ts = timeseries(date,time,'Name','MySignalName')
signal = ts.Name    % then the class will contain name
ts = ts.addsample('Time',3,'Data',420);
ts.length       % returns length obviously
getdatasamplesize(ts) % should return 1x1 if only one value is saved
# adding a field to struct:
a = struct('f',[0,10])
