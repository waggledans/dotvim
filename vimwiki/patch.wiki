patch -F3 -p0 < linux.patch 
== fuzz factor ==
-F3 sets the maximum fuzz factor. 
-p0 strip the smallest prefix containing num leading slashes from each file name found in the patch file. 
For example, supposing the file name in the patch file was
/u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c
setting -p0 gives the entire file name unmodified, -p1 gives
u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c
without the leading slash, -p4 gives
blurfl/blurfl.c
and not specifying -p at all just gives you blurfl.c.
Whatever you end up with is looked for either in the current directory, 
or the directory specified by the -d option.
