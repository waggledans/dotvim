* Example (“salary” is a variable of datatype number and of length 6.)
DECLARE
    salary  number (6);
    dept varchar2(10) NOT NULL := “HR Dept”;

* Example: The below program will get the salary of an employee with id '1116' and display it on the screen.

DECLARE 
 var_salary number(6); 
 var_emp_id number(6) = 1116; 
BEGIN
 SELECT salary

 WHERE emp_id = var_emp_id; 
 dbms_output.put_line(var_salary); 
 dbms_output.put_line('The employee ' 
  	|| var_emp_id || ' has  salary  ' || var_salary);
