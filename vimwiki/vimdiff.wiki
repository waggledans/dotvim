:set diffopt=filler
By default, diffopt is set to filler. Filler doesnt do much, it just adds vertical spaces to keep the text of the left and right pane aligned. Its a good setting, and I dont much like working without it. But there are other settings which are overlooked, even by experts.
: set diffopt+=iwhite
ignore whitespace. It makes gvimdiff ignore leading, trailing, and embedded spaces so that simple acts like retabbing or deleting vertical spaces wont obscure actual changes. It really helps you to merge changes in situations where youve adopted code that was built to entirely different standards.
:set diffopt+=icase
ignore capitalization 
:set diffopt+=horizontal
:set diffopt+=vertical
to get some help:
:options
:browse options
:browse set
In this window, you can browse through all the available options, and can even set them.
You can read the short help messages associated with each, or you can hit the enter button on any short help to see the longer help text. If you press the enter key on an option, it will toggle that option or set a new value.
